# K Nearest Neighbors Project

## Description :
In this project, I have built a k-NN Classifier to predict the party affiliation of United States Congressmen based on their voting records.

After training our model, I have calculated model performances.

Also, optimized the classification model with Hyperparamter tuning.

## Data Info :
I have used [Congressional Voting Records Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/congressional+voting+records) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
